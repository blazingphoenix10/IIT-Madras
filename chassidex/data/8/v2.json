The mechanism operates by consuming intracellular oxygen with enhanced respiratory enzymatic activity [2] and preventing molecular oxygen diffusion by extracellular alginate [3]. These features make the bacterium a potential host for the production and characterization of oxygen-sensitive proteins or organelles. Transformation of large size DNA is possible through stable genome integration [4], and common antibiotics such as ampicillin and chloramphenicol can be used in A. vinelandii for selection after transformation. Nitrogenase in A. vinelandii is most highly expressed when the nitrogen source is depleted and is inhibited when a fixed nitrogen source (i.e., NH4+) is present [5] because of the nitrogen-dependent activation of the nif operon regulated by nifL and nifA.  These bacteria form intracellular membrane-bound organelles called magnetosomes. The diameter of each vesicle encapsulating a magnetic crystal composed of magnetite (Fe3O4) or greigite (Fe3S4) is about 35\u2013120 nm [6].Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense is one of the well-studied magnetotactic bacteria. However, it is microaerophilic in nature, and microaerobic/anaerobic growing conditions are critical for magnetosome formation [1,7].", "description_refs": ["https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC94562/", "http://jb.asm.org/content/179/11/3813.short", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10938418", "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00446925", "http://jb.asm.org/content/186/3/601.full", "http://www.nature.com/nrmicro/journal/v2/n3/full/nrmicro842.html", "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2011.03063.x/pdf"], "genotype": "", "genotype_description": "", "genotype_refs": [""], "growth": "A. vinelandii was cultured in Burk\u2019s medium (B medium: 0.2% KH2PO4, 0.8% K2HPO4, 20% sucrose, 0.2% MgSO4\u00b77H2O, 0.09% CaCl2\u00b72H2O, 0.005% FeSO4\u00b77H2O, 0.1 nM Na2MoO4\u00b72H2O and 1.6% agar) or with the addition of 13 mM NH4OAc (BN medium) at 30\u00b0C at 300 rpm.", "growth_refs": ["https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC375095/"], "culture_sources": [["ATCC", "https://www.atcc.org/products/all/9046.aspx"]], "maintenance_protocols": [["", ""]], "transformation_protocols": [["Transformation of A. vinelandii was performed with a protocol from Dr. Dennis R.
