It grows optimally at 25-30 C and can be easily isolated. Due to the bacteria\u2019s strong appetite for organic pollutants, researchers are attracted to using Pseudomonas putida as the \u201claboratory \u2018workhorse\u2019 for research on bacteria-remediated soil processes.This bacteria is unique because it has the most genes involved in breaking down aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbons which are hazardous chemicals caused by burning fuel, coal, tobacco, and other organic matter.", "maintenance_protocols": [["", ""]], "genome_sequence": "", "species": "putida", "description_refs": [""], "genotype_description": "", "contributor_affiliation": "", "genus": "Pseudomonas", "genotype": "", "contributor_email": "", "tax_id": "160488", "metabolic_models": [["", ""]], "growth_refs": [""]}
