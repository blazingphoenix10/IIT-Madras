Being a eukaryote, P. pastoris is able to perform many of the post-translational modifications performed by higher eukaryotic cells and the obtained\r\nrecombinant proteins undergo protein folding, proteolytic processing, disulfide bond formation and glycosylation\r\nAnother important advantage is the secretion of the recombinant protein into the growth medium, using a signal sequence to target the foreign protein to the secretory pathway of P. pastoris.", "description_refs": ["https://www.jove.com/video/1862/expression-recombinant-proteins-methylotrophic-yeast-pichia"], "genotype": "", "genotype_description": "", "genotype_refs": [""], "growth": "Wild-type P. pastoris is able to grow on many different carbon and energy sources (Inan and Meagher, 2001), of which glycerol, glucose and methanol are the most commonly used in manufacturing processes.
