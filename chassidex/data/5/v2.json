This organelle helps the strain navigate towards optimal, microaerophillic environmental conditions. By varying culturing conditions, researchers are able to control magnetosome formation. Researchers have used magnetic bacteria to determine magnetic poles in meteorites and rocks, to synthesize gold nanoparticles, and to serve as nanorobot. Potential applications include removal of heavy metal and radionuclides, enzyme immobilization, and oxygen depletion measurement.", "description_refs": ["http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/22579104"], "genotype": "", "genotype_description": "", "genotype_refs": [""], "growth": "AMB-1 demonstrates optimal growth in microaerophillic conditions.
